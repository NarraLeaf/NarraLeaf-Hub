/**
 * The one way Team calls Lore.
 *
 * Everything that has to be got right about the call path is handled here,
 * once:
 *
 *   - **Exactly one native callback per call, released on every path.** koffi
 *     has a bounded pool of registered callbacks; leaking one per call empties
 *     it after a few thousand operations and the failure then looks nothing
 *     like its cause.
 *   - **No borrowed memory escapes.** Payloads are copied inside the callback
 *     (see ./events.ts) and collected; nothing reads FFI memory afterwards.
 *   - **No re-entry.** Calling Lore from inside a callback is forbidden, so the
 *     only work done in the callback is decoding, and the events are examined
 *     after the call settles.
 *   - **A failure says what it was.** Lore reports the detail through events
 *     rather than through the return code, so a non-zero return is turned into
 *     an error carrying the messages and the trace locations. Without them the
 *     whole of a failure is "invalid arguments".
