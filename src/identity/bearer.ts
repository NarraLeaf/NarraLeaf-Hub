/**
 * Turning an `authorization: Bearer <jwt>` header into an account.
 *
 * loreserver does not tell Team who is calling. It forwards the header the
 * client sent it, unread, and asks what that caller may reach — so identifying
 * the caller is Team's job, from a token Team itself signed a few minutes
 * earlier.
 *
 * Two questions are answered here, and both have to be:
 *
 *   - Is the token one of ours, unaltered and not expired? That is
 *     {@link verifyToken}, which reads nothing but the token.
 *   - Is the account it names still allowed anything? That needs the database:
 *     an account can be disabled, and its `token_epoch` can be bumped, after a
 *     token was signed and before it expires. Either makes the token worthless
 *     here without changing a byte of it.
