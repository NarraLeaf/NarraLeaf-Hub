/**
 * Minting the tokens a Studio installation presents to loreserver.
 *
 * The claim set is not a suggestion. loreserver 0.8.6 refuses a token that is
 * missing any of these and names the field it wanted, so every one of them is
 * written on every token:
 *
 *     iss                 matches loreserver's configured jwt_issuer
 *     aud                 an array, holding loreserver's audience and the
 *                         origin of Team's auth endpoint
 *     sub                 the user id
 *     env                 environment name
 *     name                display name
 *     preferred_username
 *     groups              array, possibly empty
 *     is_service_account  boolean
 *     idp                 which identity provider vouched for the user
 *     iat, exp
 *
 * Two claims are Team's own:
 *
 *     token_epoch         the account's `token_epoch` when this was signed
 *     authority_sha256    the fingerprint of this Team server's certificate authority
 *
 * The first is there because Team is a verifier too — it is the service
 * loreserver asks about a caller — and the epoch is what makes tokens minted
 * before a revocation refusable without keeping a list of every token ever
 * issued. loreserver ignores a claim it does not know.
 *
 * The second is read by Studio, and it is what turns trusting this Team server from a
 * paragraph of instructions into a decision somebody can make. See
 * {@link MintOptions.authorityFingerprint} for why a fingerprint carried this
 * way is worth as much as one read down a telephone.
 *
 * Nothing else is added. An extra claim is not refused, but one no verifier
 * reads would be something every token carries for nobody.

/**
 * Sign a token for `user`.
 *
 * What revoking access does, and what it does not
 * ----------------------------------------------
 * loreserver checks a token's signature and its expiry. It asks Team nothing
 * else: there is no introspection call, no revocation list, and no callback.
 * Team therefore cannot withdraw a token it has already handed out.
 *
 * What that means in practice:
 *
 *   - Disabling an account takes effect at once for anything that mints or
 *     exchanges a token. This function refuses outright, and so does the sign-in
 *     path; the account cannot obtain anything new from the moment it is
 *     disabled.
 *   - Bumping the user's `token_epoch` refuses that token everywhere Team is the
 *     one checking it: the epoch is written into the token, and {@link
 *     verifyToken}'s caller compares it with the account's epoch as it stands
 *     now. Since every repository access goes on to ask Team, that is nearly
 *     everywhere.
 *   - Against whatever does not ask Team, a token already in someone's hands
 *     keeps working until `exp`. Nothing in this system can stop that, short of
 *     rotating and retiring the signing key, which invalidates everybody's
 *     tokens at once.
 *
 * Why there are two lifetimes and not one
 * ---------------------------------------
 * That last point is the whole of the difference between them.
 *
 * A sign-in token is one Team is asked about every time it matters. It comes
 * back to Team to be exchanged, and the exchange refuses a disabled account or a
 * stale epoch on the spot; so does the permission question loreserver asks on
 * every repository access. Its expiry is not what bounds it, so it lasts thirty
 * days rather than making somebody sign in again every quarter of an hour.
 *
 * A repository token is presented on the data connection, to loreserver's data
 * plane, and Team is not necessarily consulted again before it expires. Nothing
 * done here reaches a connection that is already open. The lifetime is that
 * token's only bound, which is why it is fifteen minutes however inconvenient
 * that is, and why lengthening it is not the same kind of decision as
 * lengthening the other one.
