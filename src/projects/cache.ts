/**
 * Hub's own checkouts of the projects it serves.
 *
 * The rule this file exists to hold
 * ---------------------------------
 * **Hub never opens the store loreserver is serving.** A repository lock is
 * exclusive, and it is exclusive within one process as hard as between two:
 * opening a store loreserver holds does not fail and does not time out. It
 * waits, at no CPU, with nothing logged, for a lock that will not be released
 * while the server is running. There is no setting to tune and no error to
 * catch — the read simply never returns, and so does everything queued behind
 * it.
 *
 * So Hub reads a project the way a Studio installation on somebody else's
 * machine reads it: as a client, over the network, against its own loreserver.
 * It clones into a directory of its own and opens that. Every path a Lore call
 * is given comes from {@link projectCheckoutPath} and from nowhere else.
 *
 * What the cache is
 * -----------------
 * One checkout per project, under `<root>/cache/`, with nothing checked out.
 * It is disposable by definition: deleting the whole directory, at any moment,
 * costs the time of the next read and nothing else. Nothing is kept here that
 * is not also in the repository it came from, so there is nothing in it to
 * lose.
 *
 * Why nothing is checked out
 * --------------------------
 * A full clone of a project costs its whole content twice over — once on the
 * wire and once on disk. A bare one costs neither: measured against a
 * repository holding an 8 MB asset, 187 ms, nothing on the wire, and 2 448
 * bytes on disk. What it leaves behind still answers everything Hub asks — the
 * branch, the history and each revision's metadata come off the disk with no
 * network at all, and the revision tree and any file in it are read through
 * the store, which fetches what it needs on demand. The cost tracks the shape
 * of the tree rather than the size of the content.
