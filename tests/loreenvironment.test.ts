// The two variables the version control library reads out of the environment.
//
// The regression this file exists for: Lore keeps signed-in sessions in one
// store per machine and per user, and selects one **by the host of the remote**
// rather than by the server it belongs to. A machine that has run two Team
// servers therefore has two sessions for `127.0.0.1`, and the client picks
// whichever it likes. When it picks the other one, loreserver has no signing
// key for the token, refuses the repository lookup, and the client reports "Not
// authorized to access repository" — before Team is asked anything, which is
// why the server's authorization log is empty while every project on it reads
// as unknown.
//
// So the assertion that matters here is the dull one: the store Team signs in
// through is under the storage root and belongs to that root alone. There is
// nothing to reproduce in a unit test about what the native library does with a
// shared one; what can be asserted is that Team never asks it to.
